[CDTB](https://github.com/CommunityDragon/CDTB)'s Partial implementation by Nodejs 8.X+

It's super early and little partial version, even without implement any command. You can debugger code at `index.js`

I just use it to download and extract some specified pbe files, no need to fully download.
